    description:"An original board game built from the foundational gameplay elements of Settlers of Catan: Lupa's Mound carries over many of the same rules and mechanics from the classic Catan while also establishing its own unique gameplay by centering around 2 player games. A smaller board, and a single die create a faster pace that allows for quick, exciting matches.",
